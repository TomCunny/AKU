# "Automated" Kali Updater - Distro 
My tried and tested method of updating the Kali Linux distro

It seems this is one of the most common, yet most important tasks that we must undertake, yet we all seem to have a million ways to do this.

If anyone can help + add (Im learning how to manipulate files)
(Create a sources.list file in the ol' apt folder)
(Automate this script run at start up)

Id be appreciativeof any help!!
